# Plugin Flow

**Kayak** can be used not only as an out-of-the-box solution but as a plugin for **Cypress** and **Playwright**.

On the first hand, this approach gives you more flexibility and control over the test execution.
On the other hand, it requires more effort to set up and has more limitations than the out-of-the-box solution.

There are the links to the guides for the plugin usage:

- [Cypress Plugin Configuration](/guide/plugin/cypress)
- [Playwright Plugin Configuration](/guide/plugin/playwright)
